      Our products are crafted exclusively from the dreams and screams of young
      kids who wanted to show their mastery in their chosen fields, but were
      directed towards a factory for daily wages. Each cracker bursts brighter
      than their lost smiles, and can be heard louder than their cries for
      miles. Buy them, burst them, brag about them.

    <p className="tagline">The choice is yours. Because they donâ€™t have one.</p>
